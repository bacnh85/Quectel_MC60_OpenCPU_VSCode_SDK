[DESCRIPTION]:
--------------
This tool is used to generate the audio memory data from audio file. Withe the memory data of audio, OpenCPU can compile the audio data into App bin.


[USAGE]:
--------------
1. edit audio.txt, add all audio files to audio.txt.
	example: add "audio\wav11k.wav" to audio.txt.

2. Run "QlAudioResGen.exe", which will build all audio files to the audio stream data in audio.txt.

3. QlAudioResGen.exe will create resource_audio.c and resource_audio.h, then copy these two files to your project, or just copy the content of array to your codes.

4. To play audio resource bin to remoute side in call, you can call the APIs:
      RIL_AUD_PlayMemBg()/RIL_AUD_StopPlayMemBg()

   To play audio resource bin in idle (not in call), you can call the APIs:
      RIL_AUD_PlayMem()/RIL_AUD_StopPlayMem()


Note:
   You can compile the example_audio.c to test this feature.
   Test procedure:
   1. compile and run example_audio.c
   2. Input commands through MAIN uart port.
      "set channel: <0/1/2>"   (set audio channel, normal/headset/handfree)
      "play audio mem=<1/2/3>,0"  (play audio with mp3/amr/wav format)

   
   if play audio to remote side in call, you need establish voice connection before playing audio.
   1. compile and run example_audio.c
   2. Input commands through MAIN uart port.
      "set channel: <0/1/2>"   (set audio channel, normal/headset/handfree)
      "ATDxxx;"  (dial a cellphone number, or answer a call with "ATA")
      "play audio mem=2,0"  (play audio with amr format)
